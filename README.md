# OpenBionics - Anthropomorphic Robot Hands

Anthropomorphic, adaptive robot hand with tendon-driven, multidirectional fingers. The fingers employ an actuation mechanism that can achieve both flexion/extension and adduction/abduction concurrently in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, using two actuators. The two actuators offer increased power transmission during the execution of precise grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks. A design optimization framework utilizes results of hand anthropometry studies to derive key parameters of the actuation design.

## Contents

In this repository you can find:
